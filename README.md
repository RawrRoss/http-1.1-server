# Simple HTTP 1.1 Server

This is a simple HTTP 1.1 web server library written in Java (21) that is capable of accepting and parsing HTTP requests. Dynamic responses are generated by applications that implement a `request handler`.

## Library Features

- URI and query parameter decoding
- Keep-Alive support
- Multithreaded socket connections
- File streaming

## Dependencies

Internally, the HTTP server library utilizes Apache Commons Text, Commons I/O, and jsoup. Dependencies are managed by Gradle, and the dependency on jsoup is exported to applications as it is required by the server's API.

## Running Examples

The example applications found in the [`/examples`](/examples) directory can be launched using the command `gradlew [project name]:run`, with the project name obtained from `gradlew projects`.

## Debugging - VSCode

Applications can be debugged using VSCode and the [Gradle for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-gradle) extension.
