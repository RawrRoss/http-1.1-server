# Simple HTTP 1.1 Server

This is a simple HTTP 1.1 web server library written in Java (21) that is capable of accepting and parsing HTTP requests. Dynamic responses are generated by applications that implement a `request handler`.

## Library Features

- URI and query parameter decoding
- Keep-Alive support
- Multithreaded socket connections
- File streaming

## Dependencies

Internally, the HTTP server library utilizes Apache Commons Text, Commons I/O, Log4j, and jsoup. Dependencies are managed by Gradle, and the Log4j and jsoup dependencies are exported as APIs of the library.

## Running Examples

This project uses Gradle 8.5 for building and dependency management, and the project is tested with Java version 21. Gradle requires Java to be installed.

The example applications found in the [`/examples`](/examples) directory can be launched using the command `gradlew [project name]:run`, with the project name obtained from `gradlew projects`.

## Debugging - VSCode

Applications can be debugged using VSCode and the [Gradle for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-gradle) extension.
